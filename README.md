how to run:

uh
open the terminal (cmd + space, type in terminal, and press the one that literally says "Terminal")

then just run `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/totallynotinteresting/crossover/main/patch.sh | bash`

then open /Applications/CrossOver.app, should all be good, i hope :p

if u hav question open an issue, if u have improvements, do not suggest some because i am a cocky nerd (you can still open a pr if u want)

uhh i'll make an uninstaller sometime when i can remember to

to codeweavers: dont charge so much for reskinned wine and this wouldnt happen
